Hello! Thanks for your interest in my projects!

This is a space where I keep my past and current projects and endeavors. 
I'm primarily interested in learning as many programming languages 
and techniques as I can. Currently, I am working on learning video
game design and construction using Unity, and at the same time trying
to learn more about AI/ML techniques. 

I'll use this space not only as version control, and a record of what I've
done, but also as a way to write about what I'm working on each week and 
to keep me on track.

If anything you find here sparks your interest and you'd like to chat,
you can reach me at obg@dal.ca
