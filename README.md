Hello! Thanks for your interest in my projects!

I'm passionate about nature, boardgames, and societal change. Most of my
projects will focus on using data science to gather insights related to these topics.
I studied physics and mathematics in academia, until changing course to 
focus on applying those problem solving skills in the real world.

If anything you find here sparks your interest and you'd like to chat,
you can reach me at obgibbs@gmail.com.
